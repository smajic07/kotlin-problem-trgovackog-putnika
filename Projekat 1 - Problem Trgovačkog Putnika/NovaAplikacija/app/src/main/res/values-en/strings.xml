        \n\nThe problem of the traveling salesman, the logistical problem of everyday life, is solved in graph theory.
        It is similar to the problem of the Chinese postman. It is solved by trying to find a walk that will pass at
        least once through each vertex on the graph and return to the initial vertex, doing so in the shortest possible way,
        using a directed or undirected graph.\nThe distances between the peaks can also be specified, so it is required
        that the total distance traveled is the smallest. It is a comparison with a postman moving through the streets
        (in the mathematical model it is a graph) and has the task of delivering shipments to each house (the tops of the graph in question),
        in the shortest time and return to the post office (starting point). The postman wants to spend as little time,
        effort and money as possible to complete his task, using the shortest route.
